# ExampleANN

Python 2.7 code for a Single-Layer-Perceptron (slp) and a flexible Multi-Layer-Perceptron (mlp)

The code is not designed to be efficient, sophisticated or whatever - but just to be easy to read and understand. The implementation was done according to the pseudo-code in "Russell,Norvig, Artificial Intelligence" and "Hertz,Krogh,Palmer, Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation". Look there (or in any other textbook chapter about ANNs) for a detailed explanation.
